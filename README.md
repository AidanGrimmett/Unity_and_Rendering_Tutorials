# Welcome!
In this repository I am following the amazing [Catlike Coding Unity tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) by Jasper Flick.

This is being worked on in my spare time, to work towards my personal goal of learning more about graphics programming and eventually turn that into my area of expertise in game development.

Thanks for taking a look!
